== Introduction
The power industry must transform to accommodate the **green transition**, adopting innovative tools and methods to revolutionize how we perform power system analyses. Extracting data from power system models modeled according to the **Common Information Model (CIM)** standards (IEC 61970, 61968, 62325) is an integral part of this analytical work.

However, crafting the required **graph queries** often exceeds the capabilities of many power system engineers due to their complexity. Inspired by advancements in AI, such as Chat-GPT, we envision a future where power system engineers can receive **trustworthy and explainable answers** through **natural language queries**.

== Vision
Our vision is to create a system that allows power system engineers to:
* **Query complex models in natural language**: Eliminate the need for specialized query language expertise.
* **Receive trustworthy answers**: Ensure results are reliable, transparent, and align with established industry standards.
* **Accelerate decision-making**: Streamline workflows to support the **green energy transition**.

== Purpose
This repository supports R&D efforts to accelerate progress toward this vision. Specifically, it focuses on:
* Enabling natural language interfaces for querying **CIM-based power system models**.
* Ensuring queries and results are explainable, traceable, and compliant with standards.
* Bridging the gap between power system engineering and advanced AI methodologies.

== Key Standards and Technologies
This work leverages the following key standards and technologies:
* **Common Information Model (CIM)**: Standards IEC 61970, IEC 61968, and IEC 62325.
* **Graph Databases and Queries**: Supporting the querying of CIM models stored as graphs.
* **AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Inspired by large language models like Chat-GPT.
