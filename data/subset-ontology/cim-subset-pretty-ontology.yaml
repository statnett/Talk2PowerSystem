  qudt:QuantityKindDimensionVector:
    descr: |-2
      
       $\text{Quantity Kind Dimension Vector}$ describes the dimensionality of a quantity kind in the context of a system of units. 
       In the SI system of units, the dimensions of a quantity kind are expressed as a product of the basic
        physical dimensions mass ($M$), length ($L$), time ($T$) current ($I$), amount of substance ($N$),
         luminous intensity ($J$) and absolute temperature 
         ($\theta$) as $dim \, Q = L^{\alpha} \, M^{\beta} \, T^{\gamma} \, I ^{\delta} \, \theta ^{\epsilon} \, N^{\eta} \, J ^{\nu}$.
      
      
        The rational powers of the dimensional exponents, $\alpha, \, \beta, \, \gamma, \, \delta, \, \epsilon, \, \eta, \, \nu$, are positive, negative, or zero.
      
        For example, the dimension of the physical quantity kind $\it{speed}$ is $\boxed{length/time}$, $L/T$ or $LT^{-1}$,
         and the dimension of the physical quantity kind force is $\boxed{mass \times acceleration}$ or $\boxed{mass \times (length/time)/time}$, $ML/T^2$ or $MLT^{-2}$ respectively.

        Units may be defined by experimental observation or by proportion to another unit not included in the system. 
        If the unit system is explicitly associated with a quantity kind system, then the unit system must define at least one unit for each quantity kind.

        A unit of measure, or unit, is a particular quantity value that has been chosen as a scale for measuring other quantities the same kind (more generally of equivalent dimension). 
        For example, the meter is a quantity of length that has been rigorously defined and standardized by the BIPM (International Board of Weights and Measures). 
        Any measurement of the length can be expressed as a number multiplied by the unit meter. 
        More formally, the value of a physical quantity Q with respect to a unit (U) is expressed as the scalar multiple of a real number (n) and U, as  $Q = nU$.
