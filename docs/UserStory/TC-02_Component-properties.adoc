| Question | Notes

| What are the properties of X? | Here we expect the answer to contain relevant properties (like `r`, `r0` and `x`) depending on the component type and model. For asset-oriented models, we expect the system to pull datasheet values when relevant (PowerSystemResource -> Asset -> AssetDatasheet).
| Who owns X? | Important to differentiate between owner and operator, also note this is represented differently depending on CIM version and model source system.
| What are the analogue and digital measurements associated with X? | System should answer with a list of Measurement objects, along with a description of each to help the user understand what's being measured. Important to return identifiers.
| Which time series contains the voltage measurements of X? |
| Which time series contains the voltage measurements of the high winding at station X? | Assume station X only contains a single power transformer.

NOTE: In the example questions, replace "X" with a component name, mRID or a reasonably unambiguous description.
