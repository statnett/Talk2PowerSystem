.Definition:
As a ModelOps Release Manager, I want an automated deployment pipeline of as-built model of the power system, so that I can push validated models to read-only repositories to make it available for all relevant application.

.Description:
* Automate the process of validating, packaging, and deploying models in a CI/CD based pipeline.

.Acceptance Criteria:
* The pipeline supports deployment to read-only repository.
* The system sends notifications for failed pipeline stages.
* Only models that pass validation are deployed to the read-only repository.

.Priority:
High

.Dependencies:
* CI/CD system (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions or dedicated solution).
* GitHub based repository.
* Read-only repository.

.Notes:
* can we use existing e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions or do we need to build a dedicated CI/CD solution
