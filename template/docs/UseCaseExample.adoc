.Description:
* Automate the deployment of machine learning models to a Kubernetes cluster using a CI/CD pipeline.

.Actors:
* Primary: ModelOps Release Manager
* Secondary: CI/CD System, Data Scientist

.Preconditions:
* The model is registered and validated in the Model Registry.
* The CI/CD pipeline is configured with access to Kubernetes.

.Main Flow:
1. ModelOps Release Manager pushes model code to the repository.
2. CI/CD pipeline is triggered automatically.
3. System runs tests (unit tests, integration tests, and model validation).
4. If tests pass, the model is packaged as a Docker container.
5. Docker container is deployed to the Kubernetes cluster.
6. Notifications are sent about deployment success.

.Alternate Flow(s):
* If tests fail, the system halts deployment and sends a failure notification.

.Postconditions:
* The model is successfully deployed and available for inference.

.Triggers:
* A push event to the model repository branch configured for deployment.

.Exceptions:
* Missing Kubernetes credentials.
* CI/CD pipeline configuration errors.
